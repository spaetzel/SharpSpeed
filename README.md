SharpSpeed
=============

SharpSpeed is a small utility providing clean calls to the [Dailymile](http://dailymile.com/) API.

Currently the library supports reading data out of dailymile. OAuth support for posting to the API is coming soon.

View the tests in SharpSpeedConsole/Program.cs for examples on how to use the library
